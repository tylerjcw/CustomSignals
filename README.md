# Custom Signals #
This modification to Factorio adds a few different sets of virtual signals. Currency, Directional, Punctuational, and Mathematical operators are added by this mod. I have plans to expand the mod in to different modules. One module for math, one module for punctuation, etc. Let me know what you guys think of that idea.

## Organization ##
+ Punctuation = White Background ![White](http://i.imgur.com/FphYuiu.png)
+ Mathematics = Blue Background
+ Currencies = Yellow Background
+ Directions = Red Background

Code modified from the [Kana Signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Kana%20Signals) mod by [GotLag](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag). Credit for code, and inspiration for the basic idea, goes to GotLag.
