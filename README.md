# Custom Signals #

## Description ##
This modification to Factorio adds a few different sets of virtual signals. Currency, Directional, Punctuational, and Mathematical operators are added by this mod. Everything has been tested on a vanilla version of Factorio, and a heavily modified version of Factorio, and this mod is garaunteed to not interfere with any other mods you may be running.

## Aditional Information ##

Code modified from the [Kana Signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Kana%20Signals) mod by [GotLag](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag). Credit for code, and inspiration for the basic idea, goes to GotLag.

I want to add a video tutorial on how to add signals of your own, but this may take some time. All resources for adding your own signals are included. It honestly only takes adding a couple lines of code in a few files to get a new custom signal working (plus creating a graphic for that signal).

I have plans to expand the mod in to different modules. One module for math, one module for punctuation, etc. Let me know what you guys think of that idea.
